=• Implemented SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest models for predicting diseases by checking various symptoms
• Achieved accuracies of 82.64%, 94.2% and 96.57% respectively and compared by plotting a graphical representation
• Computed F1 score, plotted a Confusion Matrix heatmap to visually illustrate the strength of correlation among variables.
• Used 10-Fold Cross Validation on training set and test dataset to estimate the performance of each model applied
